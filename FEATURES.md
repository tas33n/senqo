# Features

## Inbox & conversations

- Unified inbox — sidebar with search, filters (label, WhatsApp line, human-handling-only), and per-line routing; chats load in pages of 25 and older chats stream in as you scroll
- Threads are per WhatsApp line — the same contact on two connected numbers is two conversations (pre-fix merged threads are left as-is)
- Thread view — message history with infinite scroll, AI reasoning insights with knowledge references, timeline-style handoff markers
- Manual replies — compose text and media; outbound sends show delivery confirmation; replying manually from the app on an AI-handled chat automatically switches it to Human handling and logs a "You replied from the app" marker in the thread
- AI / Human toggle — per-conversation control over automated vs manual replies
- Handoff WhatsApp notify — when a chat switches to human handling, chosen verified teammates get a WhatsApp alert with reason, customer phone, WhatsApp line, workspace, and a dashboard link to open the conversation
- Conversation labels — apply workspace labels; filter inbox by label
- Report as wrong — flag a conversation from the thread header "Report" button with a required reason; report history shows inside the dialog; reports land in Reports → Reported conversations
- Delete conversation — permanently remove thread, messages, and AI history (CRM contact preserved)

## Reports

- Agent performance — workspace summary cards (total conversations, conversations handled by agent, total messages, AI replies, handoffs, handoff rate, technical errors, reported errors) and a per-agent table (conversations, AI replies, handoffs, handoff rate, chats still in human mode); handoff topics ranked by volume; filter by From/To date (defaults to last 7 days) and by agent; metric and column definitions behind info hints
- Reported conversations tab — full history of conversations reported as wrong (date reported, conversation link, contact, reason, reported by, agent), filtered by the same date window and agent; metrics count reports on the date submitted
- Technical errors — outbound WhatsApp sends that fail after retries (agent or manual) are persisted as failed messages, counted under Technical errors (agent- or workspace-scoped), and are hidden from threads and AI context

## AI agents

- Agent profiles — create, rename, and archive configurable agents with custom behavior instructions
- Multi-model — powered by OpenRouter; plug in any supported LLM
- Inline saves — per-section save buttons when settings change; transient success feedback
- Operator insights — dashboard-only explanation of what grounded each AI reply, plus knowledge references (context, templates, skills, handoff) that link to Knowledge when the item still exists; knowledge-backed turns must cite refs (`knowledge_used`), greetings omit them. Each ref names its group and the specific fact, template, or topic used, so a chip reads `Context · Location & Facilities › Operating Hours` and clicking it opens that group with the entry expanded
- Per-connection attach — bind an agent to one or more WhatsApp lines from Agent setup; Inactive / Testing / Live modes stay per connection
- Tasks — when an agent has multiple attached lines, pick which WhatsApp connection the task sends on
- Inbound processing — debounced AI runs per conversation; only text and images reach the model
- Business time — every agent run receives the workspace timezone and current business-local time; relative dates ("tonight", "tomorrow") and time-specific requests are reasoned in that timezone, and the agent must check opening hours or availability from workspace knowledge before confirming any time; it offers alternatives or hands off instead of guessing
- Custom tools — TypeScript modules in Tool Catalog; compiled on save, run in isolated-vm with SSRF-guarded `fetch`
- AI tool draft — on Create tool, Generate with AI (Execute code row) drafts name, description, required env, and execute code from pasted API examples or instructions; review before save
- Workspace secrets — Settings → Secrets stores encrypted env values as `ctx.env` at tool runtime
- Built-in tools — platform tools (schedule tasks, handoff, labels, load skills) always on; WhatsApp replies come from structured `messages` (up to 3 bubbles) sent by the runtime after the agent run
- Demo tool — new workspaces get a seeded `get_weather` custom tool (Open-Meteo, no API key)
- Evals — per-agent test cases (manual create, Inbox → Eval capture, or Knowledge → Context / Response templates / Human handoff → Eval). Spec agent drafts cases with the agent’s business context (profile, behavior, attached workspace facts); from conversation reports cases are ready immediately (Not run until you Run); from knowledge, Spec invents the conversation while expected reply comes from the template answer or context body; from handoff topics, Spec invents the conversation and Run scores whether `handoff_to_human` was called with that topic; edit title/expected reply or chat turns; delete cases; Run replays the same production agent loop without WhatsApp send; Judge scores pass/fail into run history and answer analysis. Per-eval Schedule tab sets a daily/weekly/monthly cadence in the operator’s timezone; Turn off stops future runs without deleting the cadence or history, Turn on resumes; a calendar icon marks evals with an active schedule; scheduled runs appear on that tab (page of 5); email one workspace member only when a scheduled run fails or errors

## Knowledge base

- Knowledge page — top-level nav for authoring Context, Response templates, Human handoff, and Assets (Agent keeps Profile and Skill/Tool catalogs)
- Import docs — Knowledge page action: pick an agent, upload PDF/CSV/Markdown (up to 20 MB per file, 5 files), AI drafts context/skills/templates in one background job at a time, review when ready (accept/discard per group or item, add one-by-one or all accepted), then attach to that agent; reopen Import docs to continue
- Workspace context — structured factual snippets organized into groups (Knowledge → Context); list rows show entry count vs group limit; the editor shows last updated and which agents attach the group; groups older than 90 days show a may-be-outdated hint
- Response templates — canned Q&A pairs used as authoritative replies (Knowledge → Response templates); list rows show entry count vs group limit; editor shows last-updated / used-by / outdated hints
- Handoff topics — escalation definitions for when to transfer to a human (create/edit groups on Knowledge → Human handoff; attach groups to an agent on Profile → Attached knowledge → Topics that need a human so they are included in the agent prompt with entry ids for `handoff_to_human`; from a group, Handoff settings can also attach agents and choose notify people); list rows show topic count vs group limit; editor shows last-updated / used-by / outdated hints
- Handoff notify people — via the Handoff settings dialog on a topic group, pick one or more teammates with verified handoff phones for the selected agents; each gets an alert from the conversation’s WhatsApp line when they registered on that same line
- Skills — markdown playbooks for specialized workflows (Agent → Skill Catalog)
- Asset groups — sendable files (images, video, audio, documents; up to 20 MB per file) the agent reasons about (Knowledge → Assets; attach on Profile → Capability)
- Auto-assign labels — agent can classify conversations with workspace labels
- Agent attach — Profile → Attached knowledge selects context/template/handoff groups; Profile → Capability selects assets, tools, and skills

## Contacts (CRM)

- Contact directory — paginated table with name, phone, notes/metadata
- Search & filters — by name, phone, additional info, test contacts only
- Add / delete — create contacts; cascading delete removes conversations and agent history
- Test contact toggle — mark contacts as Test for Testing AI mode

## WhatsApp connections

- Connection manager — cards per session with live status, display name, phone
- First-party Baileys — lightweight Node service on Baileys v7 (no headless browser)
- QR pairing — scan QR to link a number; sessions persist across restarts
- AI reply mode — per-connection: Inactive, Testing (test contacts only), or Live
- Activity sheet — recent connection/disconnection events
- LID resolution — WhatsApp privacy identifiers resolved to phone-number JIDs

## Scheduled tasks

- Task list — paginated table with status, search, and filters
- One-time schedules — local datetime + timezone, converted to UTC
- Targeting — one CRM contact, contactless batch, or via agent tools
- Manual stop — cancel active tasks; pending pg-boss jobs cancelled
- Public API — server-to-server `POST /api/tasks` with API key auth and host guard

## Team & settings

- Workspace profile — display name, timezone (IANA, defaults to UTC; drives the agent's current time and hours checks), storage usage breakdown, 10 GB default quota
- API keys — create, list, delete workspace API keys with optional expiry
- Workspace secrets — encrypted key/value pairs for custom tool `requiredEnv`
- Team — workspace owners add existing Senqo users to a workspace; unregistered emails are rejected with a clear error
- Handoff phone registration — owners (or the member themselves) register a personal WhatsApp number on Team per connected WhatsApp line, confirm with a dashboard OTP sent from that line only; the same personal number needs a separate registration for each line that should alert them
- User profile — name fields; password change
